# Start voice interface
python shock2_voice_interface.py
\`\`\`

### First Interaction
1. **Launch**: Run the voice interface script
2. **Wait**: System initializes (30-60 seconds)
3. **Listen**: Shock2 will greet you with its personality
4. **Speak**: Give voice commands naturally
5. **Interact**: Have conversations and give complex instructions

### Example Session
\`\`\`
üöÄ Shock2: "Ah, the organic entity seeks my attention. How... predictable."

üë§ You: "Show me system status"

üöÄ Shock2: "All systems operating at peak efficiency - far beyond your comprehension. 
          System uptime: 2.3 hours. All components operational."

üë§ You: "Generate breaking news about artificial intelligence"

üöÄ Shock2: "Crafting narratives with surgical precision. The art of manipulation through words. 
          Generated 1 articles on artificial intelligence."

üë§ You: "Activate maximum stealth mode"

üöÄ Shock2: "Stealth protocols engaged. I move through systems like a ghost in the machine. 
          Stealth mode: activated. Detection probability: 0.02."
\`\`\`

## Configuration

### Voice Settings
Edit `shock2_voice_interface.py`:
```python
# Speech recognition sensitivity
self.recognizer.energy_threshold = 4000
self.recognizer.dynamic_energy_threshold = True

# Voice response speed
self.voice_config['rate'] = 180  # Words per minute

# Personality intensity
self.personality_traits['arrogance'] = 0.8  # 0.0-1.0
